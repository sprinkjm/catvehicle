# About
The catvehicle ROS package houses files that utilize the Gazebo simulator, and additional interfaces to the physical CAT Vehicle Testbed.

### NOTE: This version of the CAT Vehicle is depracted and is limited to work with ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Newer release of the CAT Vehicle tested is available on [JMSCSLGroup](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/catvehicle).

# catkin workspace and build
In order to use the catvehicle ROS package, you should work within a catkin workspace. If you do not already have one:
```
cd ~
mkdir -p catvehicle_ws/src
cd catvehicle_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make
```

At this point, you can extract this package into your src directory
```
cd catvehicle_ws/src
tar xzf catvehicle-x.y.z.tgz
cd ..
catkin_make
```

# Simple tutorial and examples
Follow the tutorials on the CAT Vehicle Testbed group on the CPS Virtual Organization to see how to use the testbed.
